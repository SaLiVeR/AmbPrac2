The Ambulatory Practice Leaders and the Regional Ambulatory Clinical Practice Committee are committed to bringing you up-to-date, accurate and complete information that will help you realize your full professional potential.</p>
				<p>Like many departments at Kaiser Permanente, Ambulatory Care has embraced the World Wide Web, and I am confident you will find our Web site to be an outstanding resource for information about all facets of ambulatory practice.</p>
				<p>The American Academy of Ambulatory Nursing defines ambulatory Care nursing as a "unique realm of nursing practice. It is characterized by rapid, focused assessments of patients, long-term nurse/patient/family relationships, and teaching and translating prescriptions for care into doable activities for patients and their caregivers. Ambulatory care nursing is a specialty practice area that is characterized by nurses responding rapidly to high volumes of patients in a short span of time while dealing with issues that are not always predictable."</p>
				<p>As part of the continuum of patient care, we have a number of initiatives under way. Please check the strategic initiatives for the current year by <a href="http://<?=$config->webRoot?>ambulatory-clinical-practice-committee/strategic-initatives">clicking here</a>.</p>
				<p>We hope that you will keep coming back to our web site for progress reports on our initiatives, timely information and resources. We want you to give us feedback on our web pages and suggest new ones. This is meant to be YOUR web site. Please let us know what other ideas and needs you have as we strive to become the employer of choice and the provider of choice for Ambulatory Care! We value your feedback, so please send us your questions and comments.</p>
				<p>Whatever your reason for visiting our web site, we hope you find your tour enjoyable and enriching. Happy reading!</p>
